    "Exercise: Log File Line Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a DevOps engineer tasked with creating a memory-efficient tool for parsing large log files. A full-featured log parsing library might be too heavy, and loading a multi-gigabyte file into memory would be inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to write a Python generator function that reads a log file line by line, yielding only the valid log entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The function must accept a single argument: filepath (a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "    It must open and read the file specified by filepath.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It must yield each valid log line. A valid log line is any line that is not empty and not a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Comment lines are lines that start with a # character. Whitespace before the # should be ignored (for example,        # this is a comment is still a comment).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty lines or lines containing only whitespace should be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each yielded line must have any leading or trailing whitespace removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your function must be a generator. It must use the yield keyword and should not return a list or any other collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For this exercise, you can assume the filepath provided will always be a valid, existing file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a file named sample.log with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    [INFO] Application starting...\n",
    "    [DEBUG] Connecting to database.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    # Configuration section\n",
    "      # A nested comment\n",
    "    [WARN] Deprecated feature used.\n",
    "     \n",
    "    [ERROR] Failed to process request id: 123\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating through your generator should produce the following lines in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    [INFO] Application starting...\n",
    "    [DEBUG] Connecting to database.\n",
    "    [WARN] Deprecated feature used.\n",
    "    [ERROR] Failed to process request id: 123\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How Your Solution Will Be Tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your read_log_lines function will be tested against several scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A standard log file containing a mix of valid entries, comments, and empty lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An empty file, which should produce no output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A file containing only comments and blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A file where comment lines have leading whitespace."
