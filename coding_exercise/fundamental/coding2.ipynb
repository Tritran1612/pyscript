    "You are a Junior DevOps engineer on a team that manages a critical web application. The application generates logs in a specific, consistent format. To monitor the application's health and troubleshoot issues, you need to process these logs programmatically. Your first task is to create a simple utility function that can parse a single log line into a structured, machine-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the body for the parse_log_line function in the exercise.py file. This function will accept a single string argument, log_line, which represents one line from the application's log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log lines follow this strict format: TIMESTAMP [LOG_LEVEL] MESSAGE\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example: 2024-05-20T13:45:10Z [INFO] User 'alice' logged in successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The parse_log_line function must take one string argument (log_line).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the log line is valid, the function should return a dictionary with the following three keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "timestamp: The timestamp part of the log string.\n",
    "\n",
    "log_level: The log level (e.g., \"INFO\", \"ERROR\", \"DEBUG\") extracted from the square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "message: The rest of the string after the log level part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log_level in the returned dictionary should not include the square brackets. For [INFO], the value should be INFO.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the log_line is malformed (e.g., doesn't contain the required parts, is an empty string, or None), the function must return None. A log line is considered malformed if it cannot be split into at least three parts based on spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input string: \"2024-05-20T14:00:05Z [ERROR] Failed to connect to database.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return the dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'timestamp': '2024-05-20T14:00:05Z',\n",
    "\n",
    "    'log_level': 'ERROR',\n",
    "    \n",
    "    'message': 'Failed to connect to database.'\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How Your Solution Will Be Tested\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function will be validated against a series of test cases to ensure it is both correct and robust. You should aim to handle the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid Log Scenarios (The \"Happy Path\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing a standard [INFO] log line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing a standard [ERROR] log line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctly handling a [DEBUG] log where the message itself contains multiple spaces, quotes, and other symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid and Edge Case Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "A log line where the message part is missing (e.g., 2024-05-20T11:00:00Z [WARNING]).\n",
    "\n",
    "A log line where the log level is not enclosed in square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A short, completely invalid string that doesn't match the format (e.g., \"hello world\").\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty string (\"\") passed as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A None value passed as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-empty list is passed as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all invalid and edge case scenarios, your function is expected to return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck! This utility will be the first building block in our new log analysis toolkit."
