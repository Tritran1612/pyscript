    "Exercise: Object-Oriented Deployment Manager - Core Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a senior DevOps engineer designing a new deployment tool. Your first step is to create the core logic for a Deployment class. This class will model a software deployment, encapsulating its state and version history. For this part, you will focus on the \"happy path\" and assume all inputs are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the Deployment class in exercise.py. This class must provide a specific public interface to manage a deployment's state and history.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __init__(self, service_name, environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "A new deployment object should be initialized with an initial status of 'pending' and no deployed version. It should store the service_name and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "service_name and environment are expected to be strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. deploy(self, new_version):\n",
    "\n",
    "A deployment should update the status to 'deployed' and make new_version the current version. The previously current version should be retained internally to support rollbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. rollback(self):\n",
    "\n",
    "A rollback reverts the deployment to the version that was active immediately before the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rollback is only possible if there is a historical version to revert to. If not, this method must return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a successful rollback, the status should be updated to 'rolled_back', and the method should return True. Additionally, the check_status method should now return the version to which the deployment was rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. check_status(self):\n",
    "\n",
    "This method must return a dictionary with four keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "'service_name' and 'environment': The values provided during initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "'status': The current status ('pending', 'deployed', or 'rolled_back').\n",
    "\n",
    "'version': The currently active version string. If no version has been deployed, this must be None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How Your Solution Will Be Tested\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test your class based on its public behavior in a valid lifecycle scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A failed rollback attempt (as there's no history to roll back to).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two more deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two consecutive successful rollbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another failed rollback attempt once the history is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The check_status() method will be used throughout to confirm the state is correct.\n",
    "\n"
